## Plan

If I feel the need to get really creative, I will add an actual design drawing of the shed here. In the meantime, visualize a 5'd x 7'h x 9'l three sided building with a slanted roof and an open front. One post on each corner, and one post in the middle of the front and rear spans. The front posts will be 7' tall, and the rear will be 5', creating the pitch to the roof. 

### Floor Frame

Frame the floor with 2x6 sills and joists. To allow for airflow from beneath, use 5/4 x 6 decking, with one inch spacing. 

### Roof Frame

Frame the roof with 2x6 headers and rafters. If asphalt shingles are used for roofing, put down half inch sheathing on the roof. If corrugated roofing is to be used, lay strapping across the rafters. 

### Sidewalls

Sides and back should allow airflow through the wood. Use 1x6 Hemlock or decking, spaced 6" apart and attached horizontally. The front is left open to allow access and airflow.
